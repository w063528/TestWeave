# TestWeave

**TestWeave** is a local-first test management engine that weaves specs into executable test cycles.

- Scan test cases from spec files (planned: `.feature`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`)
- Manage test cycles and execution history in your repo
- Export reports (HTML/CSV planned)
- Designed to work across editors and environments (VS Code / JetBrains / CLI / server)
